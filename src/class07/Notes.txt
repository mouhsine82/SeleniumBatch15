1.Implicit
2.Explicit


Implicit wait--> it is a global wait
and is going to wait until the Webelement is found.


Explicit wait--> is conditional wait that is going to wait until

syntax:
         WebDriverWait wait= new WebDriverWait(driver,timeOut);
        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.condition(element));
