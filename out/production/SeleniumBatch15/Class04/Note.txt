1. get an Element using CSS selector

     	a. syntax :
				tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']

the beauty about CSS selector is that instead of wiritng the full syntax u can also use shortcuts

 classname ---> tagname [classname='value']  u can write  "tagname.value"   --->   .

 ID      ---->  tagname [id='value']  u can write        "tagname#value"    --->  #

Note:

     In css selector we donot have this option of getting an element by TEXT



     but CSS has this contains method that can be used
     					 Syntax: for contains method for css

     					 tagname[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']   where  * means contains here

       CSS has someother amazing features to like
       					a.starts-with method in css:
       					     tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value'] where ^ means starts with

       					     example:  <input id="abra ca dabra hello" ,email ="rote"/>
       					     CSS using starts with method:

       					       			input[id ^= 'abra ca dab']


       					b.ends-with method in css:
								$ symbol represents ends-with method in css
							Syntax:
								tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']

								Example:
									example: <input id="abra ca dabra hello" ,email ="rote"/>

									write the CSS selector using ends with method:
									 input[id $= 'hello']

Approach to select the radio button:

1. locate the webElement in the DOM
2. write the appropriate locator to select it
3. use driver.findElement to find that in your code
4. click on it

isEnabled()--> check if the radio button can be selected or not  (if not selectable usually it is greyed out.
isDisplayed() --> checks if the webElment is displayed on the page or not
isSelected()-->checks if the radio button is selected or not (return true if selected)

1.Locators:

8 locators

1.id
2.name
3.className
4.partial link text
5.link text
6.css
7.xpath
8.Tagname

WebElement Commands:

1.clear()
2.getText()---> get the text
3.getattribute()--> get the value of a particular attribute
4. isselected()--> to check if the element is checked (clicked ) ir not
5. isdisplayed() --> is it there on the screen or not
6. isEnabled()  ---> is it clickable or are we able to send text to it incase of a text box

1. Radio buttons:

Select a radio button

approach:

1.open the dom and inspect it
2. write down the correct locator that will select it
3. find that using driver.findelement in your code
4. just simply click on it

logic building

a scenario:

lets assume there are "4" radio buttons and u wanna select the one that says "5 -15"
1.inspect the radio button that u wanna selct i.e 5 -15
2.write down the correct locator that selects the webElemtn 5 - 15
3. find the WebElment using driver.findElement through code
4. just simply click on it

is this a very good approach?????
no it is not a very good approach because in future if we want slect 0 -15 or any other value it will be a hustle

so whats the better approach

1.inspect the webElment of interest  (4 radio buttons) and find the in the dom
2. write the locator in such a way that it selects all those 4
3.find all those elements in the code using driver.findElements
4. loop throght the list and get each WebElment one by one
5. whenever while iterating u go through  figure out which attribute might help u in detecting it is your desired one (by inspecting the variable in DOM)
5. if u get your desired use if else to click on it.
